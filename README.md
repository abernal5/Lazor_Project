# Lazor_Project
Lazor Project for JHU EN 540.635

Group Members: Alonso Bernal, Cameron Carter, Cameron Guernsey

This project consists of a single python code: Lazor_Solver.py

This python code reads in .bff files that contain information about a Lazor level.

These Lazor levels are part of the Android and iPhone game "Lazors".

Once these .bff files are formatted properly, this code can solve any level provided.

Examples of these .bff files will be provided in this repository.

Thank you, and have fun!


Sincerely,


Team ACC
